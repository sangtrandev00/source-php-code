        <p class="p1">This drastic appeal for baked goods promoted baking all throughout Europe and expanded
            into the eastern parts of Asia. Bakers started baking breads and goods at home and selling them out
            on the streets.</p>
        <p class="p2">Baked goods have been around for thousands of years. The art of baking was developed early
            during the Roman Empire. It was a highly famous art as Roman citizens loved baked goods and demanded
            for them frequently for important occasions such as feasts and weddings etc. Due to the fame and
            desire that the art of baking received, around 300 BC, baking was introduced as an occupation and
            respectable profession for Romans.</p>
